# TestAuthentication

Creating a Test Authentication Scheme can streamline API testing for scenarios where Authorization is enabled. By setting up a test authentication mechanism, you can bypass actual authentication processes and simulate various user identities, claims, or roles. This approach allows you to focus on testing the functionality of your API endpoints with authorization enabled.
